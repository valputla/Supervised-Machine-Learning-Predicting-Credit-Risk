## General Information
This project examines two supervised machine learning models to determine which machine learning model works best to predict loan approval.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- LogisticRegression
- RandomForestClassifer

 
 ## Featured Notebooks and Files

* Resources - lending_data csv file
* Credit Risk Evaluator - jupyter notebook  


 ## Conclusions

Random Forest Classifier performs better with 0.9920 vs Logistic Regression at 0.9918.
